This project is based on autotools. To build and install:

1. You must have autotools and autoconf-archive installed

2. Go to where you installed the source root, say /opt/code/wsgc/proto_cpp
do ./bootstrap.sh

3. Make yourself a build directory, say: /opt/build/wsgc_test

4. Prerequisites
	- FFTW 3.3.2: for Ubuntu distributions you have to have the 12.10 release. However you can download and install the .deb
	  file from this link: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fftw3/3.3.2-3.1ubuntu1 follow the "Builds" link for your 
	  architecture and look for the libfftw3-3 libfftw3-bin and libfftw3-dev packages (install in this order)
	- libboost-dev (>= 1.42)
	- Cuda libraries and driver when using graphics card acceleration: see README.cuda
	- g++-4.5 when compiling for Cuda
4.a. If using soft-decision Reed-Solomon with RSSoft library (see 5.a):
	- libboost-regex-dev (on some distributions it has to be installed explicitely)
	

5. Run configure that is in the source root, with above example paths, installing into /opt/install/wsgc_test:
CXXFLAGS="-g -O2" /opt/code/wsgc/proto_cpp/configure --prefix=/opt/install/wsgc_test (release with optimization)
CXXFLAGS="-g -O0" /opt/code/wsgc/proto_cpp/configure --prefix=/opt/install/wsgc_test (debug without optimization)

5a. To use Reed Solomon soft decision decoding support with rssoft library (see https://code.google.com/p/rssoft) use the following options on the configure line:
--enable-rssoft --with-rssoft=/opt/install/rssoft assuming /opt/install/rssoft is where you installed rssoft 

6. Run make
Hint: Use make -j<2*n> where n is the number of machine threads to speed up. For example on a core i7 (4 cores 2 threads each, you do: make -j16)

7. Run make install

8. Set environment variables

A typical setenv that contains all variables for use with Cuda and RSSoft is the following:
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
export RSSOFT_INSTALL=/opt/install/rssoft
export CUDA_SDK=/shared/softs/cuda-4.2_SDK
export CUDA_INSTALL=/opt/install/cuda-5.0
export PATH=$PATH:${CUDA_INSTALL}/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${CUDA_INSTALL}/lib64:${CUDA_INSTALL}/lib:${RSSOFT_INSTALL}/lib

arch=$(uname -m)

if [ $arch = 'x86_64' ]
then
   export CUDA_LIB_SUFFIX="_x86_64"
else
   export CUDA_LIB_SUFFIX=""
fi
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 

9. The programs are ready to use in /opt/install/wsgc_test/bin

- wsgc_test: runs an execution on simulated samples
             run wsgc_test -h to list all options
             example command line using some defaults: wsgc_test -s 4096 -c 1023 -C 1020 -t 2.125 -r 0.0 -N 4 -I 0 -R 16 -P 1 -B 4 -n -24 -F 63 --cuda
             -s 4096: sample rate 4096 (in arbitrary frequency units, if you make it Hz times are in seconds)
             -c 1023: chip rate 1023
             -C 1020: Gold Code sequence delay of 1020 samples (there are 4096 samples for one full Gold Code length)
             -t 2.125: Transmission frequency 2.215
             -r 0.0: Initial reception frequency - unused
             -N 4: Number of PRNs per symbol
             -I 0: PRN shift in symbol
             -R 16: Generate 16 symbols (hence 64 PRNs) in message
             -P 1: Use only one pilot PRN (two are necessary to make message synchronisation but it is not yet implemented)
             -B 4: Process 4 PRNs in one correlation batch
             -n -24 Superimpose noise so that S/N is -24 dB
             -F 63 Use 63 frequency bins for exploration around zero IF
             --cuda Use CUDA GPU acceleration. Needs to be compiled with CUDA options, see README.cuda
             
- wsgc_generator: generates and saves zero IF (if option -t 0.0) simulated samples into a file as complex (I/Q) float numbers (4 bytes) real (I) part first. 
                  You may use this file as input to a GNU Radio graph to generate actual signal (more on this later)
                  


Typical invocation of wsgc_test:
/opt/install/wsgc_test/bin/wsgc_test -s 4096 -c 1023 -C 1020 -t -1.0 -r 0.0 -N 4 -I 0 -R 16 -P 1 -B 4 -F 63 -n -24 --cuda
/opt/install/wsgc_test/bin/wsgc_test -s 4096 -c 1023 -C 1020 -t -1.0 -r 0.0 -N 4 -I 0 -R 16 -P 1 -B 4 -F 63 -n -24 -f "W:0.0,0.5,0.1,0.0/0.001,0.5,0.1,0.2"
